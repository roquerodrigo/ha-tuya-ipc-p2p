# Code Style Guide

Style conventions for the `ha-tuya-ipc-p2p` project. Before committing,
run `uv run ruff format --check .`, `uv run ruff check .` and
`uv run mypy custom_components/tuya_ipc_p2p` — all must exit cleanly.
`uv run pytest` (with the 90 % coverage gate) follows.

**Always read this file before adding or restructuring code.**

## Language

- Code is written in **English**: file names, class names, function names,
  variable names, dictionary keys, identifier strings.
- The conversation language with the user can be Portuguese or anything else;
  what is committed to disk stays English.
- User-facing strings live in `custom_components/tuya_ipc_p2p/translations/{en,pt-BR}.json`
  only — never hardcoded in Python.

## File organization

- **One top-level class per file — including TypedDicts and dataclasses.**
  Multiple semantically related classes (exception families, sensor entities
  for one platform, the typed payloads and runtime data) get grouped into a
  package directory with one class per submodule and an `__init__.py`
  re-exporting the public symbols.
  - Example: `exceptions/` contains `api_client_error.py`,
    `api_client_communication_error.py`, `api_client_authentication_error.py`,
    plus `__init__.py`.
  - Example: `data/` contains `camera_config.py`, `camera_state.py`,
    `config_data.py`, `credentials.py`, `options_data.py`,
    `diagnostics_entry.py`, `diagnostics_payload.py`,
    `stream_diagnostics.py`, `runtime.py`, plus an `__init__.py`. Every TypedDict and dataclass gets its own file — a flat
    multi-class `data.py` is migration debt, not a valid layout.
  - **Relaxations**: a TypedDict or `type` alias consumed by a single module
    may live in that consuming module instead of its own file, and leaf
    dataclasses that describe fragments of the same payload may share one
    module. The package-with-one-class-per-submodule layout remains the
    default the moment a shape is shared across modules.
- **`type` aliases are the exception: they live in `data/__init__.py`**
  alongside the re-exports (`JsonPrimitive`, `JsonValue`, `JsonObject`,
  `TuyaIpcP2pConfigEntry`), not in their own files.
- **Helper functions** may live in the same file as the single class that uses
  them (e.g. `_verify_response_or_raise` in `api.py`).
- **`__init__.py` of the integration package** wires `async_setup_entry`,
  `async_unload_entry`, `async_reload_entry` and nothing else.

## Entities: one class per entity

- **One class per entity.** Every entity gets its own dedicated class — never
  share a generic class parameterized by an `EntityDescription` subclass with
  callable fields like `value_fn` or `action_fn`. Encode the entity's behaviour
  directly in its class via `@property` and class-level `_attr_*` constants
  (or a plain `EntityDescription` instance assigned at the class level).
  - Don't write an `<DOMAIN><Platform>Description` subclass with a
    `value_fn` / `action_fn` field.
  - Do write `<DOMAIN><Name><Platform>` (e.g.
    `TuyaIpcP2pMotionBinarySensor`).
- The reason: each entity is a discrete contract; mixing them through a
  generic class hides the contract behind indirection and discourages per-entity
  refinement (icons, state attributes, custom logic).
- **Entity icons live in `icons.json`**
  (`entity.<platform>.<translation_key>.default`), keyed by the entity's
  `translation_key` — not in `_attr_icon`. The icons file supports state- and
  range-based variants and keeps presentation out of Python.

## Naming

- Public classes are prefixed with `TuyaIpcP2p` (rename to
  `<YourDomain>` when forking).
- Concrete platform entities end with the entity type:
  `TuyaIpcP2pCamera`, `TuyaIpcP2pMotionBinarySensor`.
- Exception classes end with `Error`: `TuyaIpcP2pApiClientError`,
  `…CommunicationError`, `…AuthenticationError`.
- Private attributes / functions are prefixed with `_`.

## Typing

**Strict typing. No generics, no `Any`.** Mypy (`uv run mypy custom_components/tuya_ipc_p2p`) enforces this.

Banned: `typing.Any`, `object` as a value type, bare `dict` / `list` / `tuple` /
`set`, `dict[str, Any]`, `Mapping[str, Any]`.

Required:

- `TypedDict` for known dict / JSON shapes (see the `data/` package for the
  canonical examples: `TuyaIpcP2pCameraState`, `TuyaIpcP2pConfigData`,
  `TuyaIpcP2pOptionsData`, `TuyaIpcP2pDiagnosticsPayload`,
  one per file).
- `@dataclass` for structured records (`TuyaIpcP2pData` in
  `data/runtime.py`).
- Named `type` aliases for recursive / shared shapes — `JsonPrimitive`,
  `JsonValue`, `JsonObject` in `data/__init__.py`.
- `frozenset[str]` / `tuple[str, ...]` for fixed string collections.
- `cast("TypedDictName", value)` at HA framework boundaries that hand us a
  permissive type (e.g. `entry.data` is `MappingProxyType[str, Any]`).

When narrowing an HA-provided callback signature (e.g. `async_step_user`),
mypy reports `[override]` (Liskov violation). Add `# type: ignore[override]`
with a one-line comment explaining the deliberate narrowing — see
`config_flow.py` for the canonical example.

## Properties and `__init__`

- **Always prefer `@property`** over assigning `_attr_*` values in `__init__`.
  Properties are computed lazily from backing fields stored on the parent class
  (e.g. `self.coordinator`, `self.entity_description`).
- When the body of `__init__` would only call `super().__init__(...)`, omit
  `__init__` entirely and let Python inherit the parent.
- Class-level constants like `_attr_attribution = ATTRIBUTION` and
  `_attr_has_entity_name = True` are fine — they don't depend on instance
  state.

## Imports

- Always start every module with `from __future__ import annotations` so type
  hints become lazy strings and the runtime cost of `if TYPE_CHECKING` imports
  is zero.
- Same-package relative imports (`from .module import …`) are the default.
- Move type-only imports into a `TYPE_CHECKING` block (Ruff `TC001`/`TC003`):

  ```python
  from __future__ import annotations
  from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

  if TYPE_CHECKING:
      from collections.abc import Mapping
      from .data import TuyaIpcP2pConfigData
  ```

- `noqa` comments are reserved for unavoidable framework constraints (e.g.
  `# noqa: ARG001` for HA-framework callback parameters that must exist but go
  unused). Document the reason inline if non-obvious. Never silence to "make
  ruff happy" — fix the underlying code.

## Docstrings

- Every public class, function, method (including `@property`) and `__init__`
  has a docstring. Ruff enforces this via `D102`/`D107`.
- A single sentence is usually enough. Describe the *contract* or the *why*,
  not the obvious implementation.
- Module-level docstring at the top of every `.py` file.
- Avoid restating the type — the signature already does that.

## Comments

- Default to **no comments**. Add one only when the *why* is not obvious from
  the code: a hidden constraint, a workaround, a subtle invariant, or a
  deliberate type-system override.
- Never describe *what* the code does — well-named identifiers handle that.
- **No section dividers** like `# --- API payloads ---` to group related
  declarations. If a file has so many sections that you feel the need for
  visual separators, split it into multiple files instead.

## Logging

- Each module uses the package-level `LOGGER` from `const.py`
  (`LOGGER: Logger = getLogger(__package__)`); never call `logging.getLogger(...)`
  ad-hoc.
- Use **lazy `%`-formatting**, never f-strings — they force string interpolation
  even when the level is filtered:

  ```python
  LOGGER.warning("Refresh failed: %s", exception)   # ✓
  LOGGER.warning(f"Refresh failed: {exception}")    # ✗
  ```

- Levels:
  - `debug` — successful fetch summaries, every-poll diagnostics.
  - `info` — one-shot lifecycle (setup complete, reauth flow started).
  - `warning` — recoverable failures (transient API error, falling back).
  - `error` / `exception` — unrecoverable in current cycle; pair `exception`
    with caught exceptions inside `except` blocks for full tracebacks.
- Never log secrets (`token`, `password`, `key`, full headers). The
  `Coordinator → UpdateFailed` mapping should swallow the original exception's
  string form when it could expose them.

## Error messages

- Format: `"Failed to <verb> <object>: <cause>"` where `<cause>` is the
  exception or a short reason. Keep them short and grep-able.
- Pre-validate inputs before the network call so user-facing errors point at
  the bad input, not a downstream traceback (`config_flow._validate` rejects
  malformed credentials before contacting the API).
- Custom exceptions get the same hierarchy:
  `TuyaIpcP2pApiClientError` (base) → `…CommunicationError` (timeout,
  connection, DNS) and `…AuthenticationError` (401/403). Wrap raw upstream
  errors at the API client boundary; everything above only catches the
  custom hierarchy.

## Coordinator and runtime data

- All API state flows through `entry.runtime_data: TuyaIpcP2pData`
  (`data/runtime.py`). Never store integration state in `hass.data` — `runtime_data` is
  auto-discarded on unload, the legacy `hass.data[DOMAIN][entry_id]` pattern is
  not.
- The coordinator is typed as `DataUpdateCoordinator[TuyaIpcP2pPayload]`.
  `_async_update_data` returns the typed payload.
- Use `await coordinator.async_config_entry_first_refresh()` during
  `async_setup_entry` (not `async_refresh()`) — a failed first refresh raises
  `ConfigEntryNotReady` and HA retries with backoff automatically.
- Pass `always_update=False` to the coordinator when the payload TypedDict
  compares cleanly with `__eq__`; HA then skips listener callbacks and state
  writes when the data hasn't changed.
- Use `self.async_contexts()` inside `_async_update_data` to scope API work to
  the entities currently subscribed — disabled entities shouldn't drive
  network calls.
- Error mapping inside `_async_update_data`:
  - Communication errors → `raise UpdateFailed("Failed to …: %s" % err)`. Pass
    `retry_after=<seconds>` when the upstream signals an explicit backoff (e.g.
    HTTP 429 `Retry-After`).
  - Authentication errors → `raise ConfigEntryAuthFailed(...)` — HA cancels
    further updates and starts the `SOURCE_REAUTH` flow.
  - Never let raw upstream exception strings reach `UpdateFailed` when they
    could carry tokens; convert to a sanitized message at the API client.

## Config / options / diagnostics

- `config_flow.py` carries `user`, `reauth`, `reauth_confirm` and `reconfigure`
  steps, all sharing one `_async_validate` helper and one `_credentials_schema`
  builder.
- `options_flow.py` holds the single `TuyaIpcP2pOptionsFlow`
  class. New options keys go into the `TuyaIpcP2pOptionsData`
  TypedDict in `data/options_data.py`.
- `diagnostics.py` returns `TuyaIpcP2pDiagnosticsPayload`. Sensitive
  keys go into the `TO_REDACT: frozenset[str]` constant.

## Translations

- Two locales: `en.json` and `pt-BR.json`. `tests/test_translations.py`
  parametrizes over every locale and fails if their nested key sets diverge.
- Options strings live under `options.step.init.data`; flow strings under
  `config.step.<step_id>`; selector option labels under
  `selector.<key>.options`; entity names under
  `entity.<platform>.<key>.name`.

## HACS publishing requirements

[HACS](https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/publish/integration/) validates the repository
shape on every push via `hacs/action@main` (and HA itself runs `hassfest`).
Both gates must stay green:

- **One integration per repository**, located in `custom_components/<domain>/`.
- `manifest.json` must declare `domain`, `name`, `version`, `documentation`,
  `issue_tracker`, `codeowners`. The `version` key is **mandatory for custom
  integrations** (omit it in core integrations only) and must parse as
  `AwesomeVersion` — CalVer or SemVer.
- `manifest.json` also declares `integration_type`. JSON carries no comments,
  so the choice is recorded here: this integration declares `hub` because one
  config entry is a Tuya account exposing several cameras, each of which
  becomes its own device.
- `hacs.json` at the repo root pins the minimum HA core via the
  `homeassistant` key. This is the third HA pin (see `CLAUDE.md`).
- Brand assets live under `custom_components/tuya_ipc_p2p/brand/` —
  `icon.png`, `logo.png` (+ `@2x` variants) and `icon.svg`. They carry Tuya's
  own mark, shared with the other Tuya integrations in this fleet. Home
  Assistant serves the directory directly; nothing is submitted upstream.
- A `README.md` at the repo root is required; HACS surfaces it as the
  integration description. Its header follows the layout below.

Release-please tags releases on every merge to `main`; HACS surfaces the five
most recent GitHub releases to users, so keep the changelog grep-able.

## README header

Every repository opens `README.md` with the same header, in this exact order:
**title → badges → HACS link → `---` separator → the rest of the document.**

```markdown
# <Title>

[![CI](https://github.com/roquerodrigo/<repo>/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/roquerodrigo/<repo>/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open the repository inside HACS.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=roquerodrigo&repository=<repo>&category=integration)

---
```

- `owner=` is always `roquerodrigo`; `repository=` is the repository name.
- `category=integration` for an integration; `category=plugin` for a Lovelace
  card repository.
- The HACS link is a paragraph of its own, separated from the badge block by a
  blank line. The badge row and the "Open your Home Assistant instance" button
  are different things and must not run together.
- Preserve the badges a repository already carries and invent no new ones; all
  of them belong **before** the HACS link.
- The `---` immediately after the HACS link is the header separator. A README
  that already uses `---` further down keeps those as section breaks — do not
  add a second separator to the header.

**A private repository gets no HACS link.** `my.home-assistant.io` resolves the
target through the public GitHub API, so on a private repository the button
lands on something HACS cannot install. It is the same reason those repositories
call the validate workflow with `hacs: false`. Ship the title, the badges and
the separator, and add the link when — and only when — the repository is made
public.

## Quality scale

- `quality_scale.yaml` is **optional** and this repository does not ship one.
  It is required only when `manifest.json` declares a `quality_scale` tier —
  and then every claim in it must be honest (`done` only when the rule is
  actually implemented; use `todo`/`exempt` otherwise).
- The goal is to apply the [Bronze/Silver/Gold rules](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/)
  that are pertinent to the integration; Platinum is an aspiration, not a
  review gate.

## Pre-commit hooks

`pre-commit` is a dev dependency (`pyproject.toml`) and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
runs ruff format, ruff check and mypy as **local hooks through `uv run`**, so
every commit uses the exact tool versions pinned in `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock` —
the same ones CI resolves. Never switch these to mirrored hooks
(`ruff-pre-commit`, `mirrors-mypy`): a mirrored hook carries its own version
pin that silently drifts from the project's. Install once per clone:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

The hook runs the same lint gates as CI on every commit. Skip it only on
emergency `git commit --no-verify` and immediately re-run `scripts/lint` (or
the equivalent direct commands).

## Conventional commits

All commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/),
which `release-please` parses to bump the version and generate `CHANGELOG.md`:

| Type | Meaning | Bump |
|---|---|---|
| `feat` | New feature | minor |
| `fix` | Bug fix | patch |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | patch |
| `deps` | Dependency bump | patch |
| `docs` | Documentation only | none |
| `refactor` | Refactor without behavior change | none |
| `test` | Test-only change | none |
| `ci` | CI / tooling change | none |
| `chore` | Anything else (rarely) | none |

- Subject line: imperative mood, lowercase, no trailing period.
- Use scopes when useful: `fix(sensor): map non-enum interface values to None`.
- A `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer (or `!` after type) bumps the major version.

## Linting and verification

- Ruff configuration lives in `pyproject.toml` (`[tool.ruff]`) with `select = ["ALL"]`.
- Mypy configuration lives in `pyproject.toml` (`[tool.mypy]`). Run both with
  `uv run ruff check .` and `uv run mypy custom_components/tuya_ipc_p2p`.
- After every change run `uv run ruff format --check .`, `uv run ruff check .`,
  `uv run mypy custom_components/tuya_ipc_p2p` and `uv run pytest`.
  Both gates mirror CI. `scripts/lint` is a thin wrapper that only chains
  these four commands — running it or running the commands directly is
  equivalent; the wrapper exists so CI, docs and local habits share one
  source of truth.
- Tests live in `tests/`, mirroring the production layout. The 90 % coverage
  gate (`pyproject.toml`, `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`) prevents untested code
  from sneaking in. When a test
  exercises a state that is impossible under the new types, update or remove
  it — never weaken the type to satisfy the test.
